I got into baking macarons last year because they are expensive and I like eating them so much. 
I started with a macaron recipe from Binging with Babish, and then moved towards experimenting with my own flavors.
About a year ago, I made the apple pie flavored macaron for the fall season and my friends and family loved it!
Here is the recipe for the macaron with a american buttercream and apple pie filling! 
 
## Suggested Equipment
- Scale - I highly suggest using a scale to measure out the ingredients for the macaron. 
Small changes in the ratio of dry and wet ingredients do affect the end product! 
- Stand mixer or hand mixer - I would also suggest using a mixer of some kind to make the meringue in the macaron. It can get very tiring to whip up the egg whites!
- Piping materials - definitely needed to make the macaron shape. A ziploc bag could be used as a replacement.

## Ingredients 
### Macaron
- 140g almond flour
- 130g powdered sugar
- 100g egg whites (about 3 eggs)
- 90g granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2g cinnamon
- 1g nutmeg

### American Buttercream 
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- Heavy cream or milk (add enough for desired consistency)

### Apple Pie Filling
- 1/2 apple (granny smith or your favorite kind for apple pies)
- 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions
### Macaron
1. Sift and mix together 140g almond flour and 130g powdered sugar
2. To make the meringue, put the 100g of egg whites in a bowl for the stand mixer. Whip the eggs and as they get frothy, slowly add the 90g of granulated sugar while mixing. Afterward, add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Whisk until stiff peaks.
3. Add in about 1/3 of the almond flour and powdered sugar mixture and gently fold with a rubber spatula.
4. Fully mix in the rest of the almond flour and powdered sugar. Continue mixing until a "figure 8" can be made mixture using the rubber spatula.
5. Put mixture into piping bag. Pipe out 1 inch circular dollops of mixture on to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Try to pipe out an even number of macaron shells.
6. Whack the baking sheet on the countertop to flatten out the dollops.
7. Let it sit out for 45-60 minutes. 
8. Bake at 300&deg;F for 11 minutes.
9. Let it cool down before constructing the macaron.

### American Buttercream
1. With 4 tablespoons of room temperature unsalted butter, beat the butter until its smooth and creamy by hand or using a mixer.
2. Add powdered sugar a little bit at a time while mixing until all sugar is added.
3. If buttercream is too thick, add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream or milk at a time until desired consistency.

### Apple Pie Filling
1. Finely dice 1/2 of an apple.
2. Melt about 1/2 tablespoon of unsalted butter over medium heat.
3. Add diced apples and 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.
4. Cook until apples are soften.
5. Let it cool down before constructing.

### Constructing the macaron
1. Put buttercream into piping bag.
2. Find and take 2 macaron shells that are similar in size. 
3. Pipe a circle of buttercream onto on of the cookies
4. Spoon a small amount of the cooked apples on to the buttercream.
5. Place the 2nd shell on top, completing the macaron.
6. Repeat until all macarons shells are used. This recipe should make between full 25-30 macarons.
